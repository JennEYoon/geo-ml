From Kaggle, .tar files available for download, small download icon on right.  Even though folder is empty, file still exists.  

7Zip already installed on Windows side.  
Uncompress .tar file, then open.  Both operations takes a while.  
Fully uncompressed, plus .tar file, plus jpg files uncompressed, 102 GB space, wow!  Stored on external 2TB drive.  Can't store locally on laptop SSD drive.  

Too big to upload to Github repo.  
Copied sample, 11 objects, per format. Use to figure out if I want to do any image processing, improve light and contrast if using .jpg format, test .tif format, separate out all 4 channels.  

Next - upload data to Google Drive, but pick a format before uploading all.
