# Amazon Rainforest Project - Writeup  

#### Date:    May 1, 2022, continue  
#### Author:  Jennifer E Yoon

**Purpose: To organize project report for public view**  

 * Clean notebook(s)  
 * Wiki pages - business/sales/clients audience  

**Table of Contents:**  

 * Propoal  
 * Data acquisition  
   a) Kaggle 2017 pre-processed images  
   b) NICFI data biannual 2017 - 2022. Me to do pre-processing   
   c) combine with other data sources, LanSat going back 50 years to 1970.  
 * File manipulation, image file import to jupyter notebook  
 * Color management (termal, high contrast), transforms    
 * Baseline deep learning training - 2k tiny dataset, CPU machine training.     
 * First full deep learning training - full 40K dataset, GPU machine  
 * Compare with other Kaggle/public notebooks about similar satellite dataset(s).  
 * Prediction Model  
 * Movies of deforestation over time.  
 * Try other data transforms.  
 * Try other deep learning models  
 * Try combination with machine learning models (economics, tabular data).  
 * Use other public data, tabular data on economic development  
 * Use other public data, image files from other forests training set, other urban areas training set.   
 * Use other public data, california forest fire drone data, LanSat data

## Code Cleanup to go with Writeup:  

 * Split out data acquisition and initial deep learning training into separate folders. 
 * Delete many trials, and keep few Jupyter notebooks.  
 * Redo-clean jupyter notebooks with writing.  Write first, then add code that will go into accompanying cells.  
 * Identify graphs and visuals to add. Write paragraphs first, then create the visuals.  
 * Use Word or OneNote file format first.  Write here, then copy into Jupyter notebooks with chart elements.  
 * Keep updating TOC - overall view of project.  
 * Write to geo-ml/rainforest.wiki  -- Wiki of Project.  
 * Post summaries and linke on my blog, datasciY.com/project.html.  
 * When partially done, advertise:  Hackernews, Reddit, Fastai Forums, Planet Labs, Google Earth Obs for planet data, etc.
