# Planet Notebook

This image provides the dependencies for running jupyter notebooks in the [planetlabs/notebooks](https://github.com/planetlabs/notebooks) GitHub repository. A prebuilt version of this image can be downloaded from the [planetlabs/notebook](https://hub.docker.com/r/planetlabs/notebooks) dockerhub repo (recommended). Alternatively, this image can be built locally from the Dockerfile. The specifics of building and running this image are given in the planetlabs/notebooks GitHub [README.md](https://github.com/planetlabs/notebooks/blob/master/README.md) file.

This image is based on the [jupyter/minimal-notebook](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/minimal-notebook/) image and additional tips on running the jupyter notebook can be found in the documentation for that image.
