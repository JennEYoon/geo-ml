# Working with the Unusable Data Mask (UDM) and Usable Data Mask (UDM2)

These notebooks demonstrates the basics of visualizing and working with the Unusable Data Mask (UDM). Specifications for the UDM can be found in the [Imagery Product Spec Sheet](https://assets.planet.com/docs/combined-imagery-product-spec-april-2019.pdf).

If one is only interested in masking out pixels that may have quality issues (e.g. saturation or missing), then the UDM is the best product to use. If pixel content, such as haze, clouds, or cloud shadow, is also a concern, then the UDM2 is the best product to use. UDM2, which is the newer product, contains the UDM as band 8. More information on the UDM can be found in the [udm2 folder](../udm2/).
