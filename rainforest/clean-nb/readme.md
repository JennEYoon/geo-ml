Purpose: This is a clean folder for presenting results of deep learning experiments on Amazon Rainforest satellite image data.  The purpose of the project is to help control climate change by identifying factors with the largest impact on the fragile tropical rainforest ecosystem.  First objective is to improve deep learning techniques for auto-labeling forest satellite images into categories of healthy primary forest and partially degraded forest areas.  My ultimate goal is to help make protecting the Amazon Rainforest more economically beneficial than destroying it for the local residents of the Forest.  Therefore, I will also present area economic analysis and global trade analysis.
