Update: May 14, 2024  

### Purpose:  
This is a clean folder for presenting results of deep learning experiments on Amazon Rainforest satellite image data.  The purpose of the project is to help control climate change by identifying factors with the largest impact on the fragile tropical rainforest ecosystem.  First objective is to improve deep learning techniques for auto-labeling forest satellite images into categories of healthy primary forest and partially degraded forest areas.  My ultimate goal is to help make protecting the Amazon Rainforest more economically beneficial than destroying it for the local residents of the Forest.  Therefore, I will also present area economic analysis and global trade analysis.  

### Steps:  
Level 1:  
 * Present clean notebook, baseline Resnet-34 model.
 * Gather image assets
 * Write narrative
 * Create time-lapse video of small areas selected to show degradation over time.
Level 2:
 * demonstrate auto-labelling with machine learning assit
 * Include data API, large volume data daownload and splitting into tiles, efficient processing of tiles  
 * write up experimet, gatehr images and other assets
 * add economic research angle, shipping, beef export from Brazil, global crude production volumne and prices
Level 3:
 * Improve auto-label, alternative categories, infrared usage
 * Update data model and build web dashboard
 * Build monitoring system, real-time. Shipping tracking
 * Integrate with Russian Oil Production Volume forecasting model
