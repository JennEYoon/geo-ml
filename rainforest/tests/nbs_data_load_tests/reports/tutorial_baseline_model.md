# Create tutorial for DL training baseline model  

 * ResNet34 on 2000 images, small sample, Kaggle dataset  
 * ResNet34 on 40,000 images, large sample, Kaggle dataset, use ft16. 
 * Make a few sample prediction on test dataset, compare accuracy.  

 * Dataset anlysis, how many per category, which category is most confused?  
 * Dataset statistical analysis.  
 * Show sample images using Matplotlib Pillow.  
 * Colob version, local version on CPU/GPU.  
 * fastai library load.
