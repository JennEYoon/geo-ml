# Report for Baseline training model, jupyter notebook  

### Baselin model: Write a tutorial instead of straight notebook  

 * Download data from Kaggle 2017 competiion, has both labeled training set and labeled test set.  
   - Also has "additional" labeled datase, was used for final judging by Kaggle.  
   - Sidebar: how to use Kaggle API to download dataset.  
   - Sidebar: tar and untar commands, bash/linux  
 * Load into Python fastai library, show image samples  
 * Create 2000 images small sample, run trining on this, to save time if model does not work.  
 * Use full 40,000 sample, trian. Try to overfil, then back off.just  
 * Try using subset of data, categories  
 * Try bigger model, try fp16  
 * Try infrared channel (only? for river or cloud cover?)  
 * Straight lines, road - edge detection?
