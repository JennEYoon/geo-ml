# Amazon Rainforest, image dataset loading test

### 7/29/2021 note, image load, Planet_2k, Planet_Tiny"   

* labels_y, write a custom function  
Can just be df['tags'].split(" ")
or df.tags.split(' ') >> csv file, tags column, split on space deliminiter.  
   - that is, tags column, each label split on space deliminter. 
   - but need to make sure filename == files[i] <<- No
   - files = get_items_sorted(path/'train') Don't need to sort.  get_x is passed df with image file names. 
   - where path = planet_2k data folder or planet_tiny data folder. 
   - fastai also has "PLANET_SAMPLE" , check this out?  
   
   
item_resize >>> use 256 for planet, 126 for planet_tiny.  
Before passing to pre-trained model, need to resize images to 225, many models use this size.  

data_augmentation >> none first time, then flip=Yes, random crop to smaller square.  

x_inputs randomizing >> no shuffle first, then random with ranseed 42.  

#### 8/4/2021 notes:  

  - "r" is dataframe passed-input to get_x and get_y functions.  Custom functions.
  - but need to make sure filename == files[i] <<- No, 
     - get_x reads filename from df, then get matching image file with that filename.  
     
  - tuple (get_x array, get_y array).  csv file df['tags'] and matching row df['file_name'] object collates arrays in correct order.  
  
 # Try loading model next.  Test first before fine-tuning inputs.  Test that it works.  
 
 #### 4/30/2022 tasks:  
 Train full 40,000 images on colab, maybe AWS  
 Get comfortable saving intermediate models.  
 Install fastai library to Colab instance to run.  
 
 Runusing Tensorflow and Keras.  
 
 Download recent images (Nicfi), split images and try auto-labelling with human correction.  
 Combine with Lansat images to make a historical changes movie.  
 
 Add interactivity.  Game Eco-Warriors!
