# Folder for additional training, Rainforest Project  


### Use "planet-sm" folder, 11 images.  

Label one, only one label per image.  


## Steps:  


 * Test that saved pytorch model can be re-imported and further trained.  
 
 * Test that predictions for image label classes works.  

 * Inspect most confused, manually correct any images.  

 * Get another batch of 2000 images from original, train.  Get similar results?  

 * Try .tif format images, 2000 sample.  Test these.  Check mapping of labels with instructions.  

 * Run "additional images" folder labeled data, test results.  


## Follow-up Steps:  

 * Try smaller categories, manually fix any glaring labelling problems.  

 * Download more data from Planet Labs -- use data-api.  

 * Try colorized enhanced contrast images -- download these and try training.  

 * Make predictions using location info from Planet Labs.  

 * Continue writing finding as I go.  

## Other Steps:  

 * Create visuals and maps  

 * Write blog and post link to hacker-rank, fastai forums etc.
