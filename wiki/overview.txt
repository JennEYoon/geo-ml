Amazon Rainforest Deep Learning Project 2021-2022
Explore ways to extend deep learning training to time periods with unlabeled data. (My ultimate goal is to help
the Amazon Rainforest conservation effort by making it more profitable for locals to grow and conserve the forest
than to burn it down.) Use Google Colaboratory GPU server with PyTorch and Fastai Python libraries. (See geoml repo on GitHub, https://github.com/JennEYoon/geo-ml)

Train a baseline deep learning model using ResNet34 pre-trained weights on labeled satellite image data from a
2017 Kaggle competition and Planet Labs. Reached f-beta score accuracy of 92.3%. (For comparison, #1 spot in
the 2017 Kaggle competition had 93.317% score). Download unlabeled satellite image data for 2017-2022 period
from Planet Labs and NICFI non-profit program. Pre-process data by breaking images into tiles similar to labeled
data. Auto-apply labels to new data using previously trained baseline model. On a subset of images, manually
correct and verify labels to use as test data and training data, using AI-assisted label correction. Fine tune the
baseline model on the new, unlabeled data period. Try enhancing image colors by using the infrared channel and
using only maximally contrasting categories to improve deep learning training accuracy. Experiment is on-going
