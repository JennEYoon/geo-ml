# My notes

### 5/30/2021 Sunday

Image loading into list worked.  
To show inline, need to first open the image using PIL Image. 
Matplotlib pyplot format, shows images in row.  
Figure out how to do it, but I think "batching" images is just a list of file objects, or file path names.  

 * Next, review fastai batching, how did they get images into "DataBlock" and "DataLoader"?  
 
>>> Copy from fastai v3 lesson3:   
#### src is a list, readin from file in path.
src = (ImageItemList.from_csv(path, 'train_v2.csv', folder='train-jpg', suffix='.jpg')
       .random_split_by_pct(0.2)
       .label_from_df(sep=' '))

data = (src.transform(tfms, size=128)
        .databunch(num_workers=0).normalize(imagenet_stats))
show_batch still works, and show us the different labels separated by ;.

data.show_batch(rows=3, figsize=(12,9))

#### data.show_batch() must be fastai function, data is src list, 
#### has .databunch attribute.
#### need to review code at fastai v2.
