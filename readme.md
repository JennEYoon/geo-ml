### 1) First Project, Amazon Rainforest deep learning:  
 > See project wiki:  https://github.com/JennEYoon/geo-ml/wiki   
 
 * See folder "rainforest"  
 * Python libraries:  geopandas, geojson, rasterio, planet-api  
 * Collaborators: Dan, Peter from DSML meetup   
 * Meetup group project, 2017 Planet data from Kaggle Challenge  

------------------------------------  

### 2) Second Project, geosnap-maryland machine learning project:  
  > See project wiki:  https://github.com/JennEYoon/geo-ml/wiki/geosnap  
  
 * See "geosnap-md" folder  
 * Python libraries: geosnap, pysal 
 
Second project is using ***geosnap*** and ***pysal*** libraries to create a socio-economic neighborhood map for the State of Maryland.  Use U.S. Census data. This is a slight extension of the geosnap tutorial talk from SciPy 2018 conference.
