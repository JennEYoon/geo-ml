### 1) First Project, Amazon Rainforest deep learning:  
 > See project wiki:  https://github.com/JennEYoon/geo-ml/wiki/rainforest     
 * See folder "rainforest"  
 * Collaborators: Dan Kelly, Peter Stephan (pronounced steven) from DSML meetup   
 * Python libraries:  geopandas, geojson, rasterio, planet_data_api  

------------------------------------  

### 2) Second Project, geosnap-maryland machine learning project:  
  > See project wiki:  https://github.com/JennEYoon/geo-ml/wiki/geosnap  
  
 * See "geosnap-md" folder  
 * Python libraries: geosnap, pysal 
 
Second project is using ***geosnap*** and ***pysal*** libraries to create a socio-economic neighborhood map for the State of Maryland.  U.S. Census data used. This is an extension of a SciPy 2018 Conference tutorial.
