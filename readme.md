### 2) Second Project, geosnap-maryland machine learning project:  
  > See project wiki:  https://github.com/JennEYoon/geo-ml/wiki/geosnap  
  
 * See "geosnap-md" folder  
 * Python libraries: geosnap, pysal 
 
Second project is using ***geosnap*** and ***pysal*** libraries to create a socio-economic neighborhood map for Virginia and Maryland.  Source data is from U.S. Census.
